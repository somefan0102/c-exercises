/*
507: Rewrite `readlines` to store lines in an array supplied by `main`, rather than
     calling `alloc` to maintain storage. How much faster is the program?
514: Modify the sort program to handle a `-r` flag, which indicates sorting in reverse
     (decreasing) order. Be sure that `-r` works with `-n`.
515: Add the option `-f` to fold upper and lower case together, so that case
     distinctions are not made during sorting; for example, `a` and `A` compare equal.
516: Add the `-d` (``directory order``) option, which makes comparisons only on
     letters, numbers and blanks. Make sure it works in conjunction with `-f`.
517: Add a field-searching capability, so sorting may bee done on fields within lines,
     each field sorted according to an independent set of options.
