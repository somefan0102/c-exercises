503: Write a pointer version of the function `strcat` [...]
504: Write the function `strend(s,t)`, which returns 1 if the string `t` occurs at the
     end of the string `s`, and zero otherwise.
505: Write versions of the library functions `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `strncmp`, which
     operate on at most the first `n` characters of their argument strings. [...]
506: Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers
     instead of array indexing. [...]
